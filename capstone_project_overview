Capstone Project Overview and Description

All Computer Engineering students take Capstone and Senior Project, each two quarters long. Simply put, Capstone is a group senior project and is assigned
from an already existing project. In Capstone, outside organizations propose projects that Cal Poly students can complete that
will benefit both the students and the participating organization. These organizations can be companies, government departments, 
and even other Cal Poly professors. 
My Capstone project is "Fault Injection using JTAG" from Cisco. For this project, my capstone group is studying the feasibility of 
software-based fault injection using JTAG. Essentially, we are flipping bits in memory and studying how errors propagate through 
a system. Due to privacy concerns, I won't be posting any code or anything too specific. I'll be mainly focus on my 
responsibilities in the group. As of right now, I am responsible for creating a human-friendly memory map that displays memory
stats and revelant memory areas. I use the tkinter package in Python to create the GUI.
I will update this as I continue to work on the project.

Ideas:
-Use pycparser to parse global variables from source code.
-find more debug compiler options
